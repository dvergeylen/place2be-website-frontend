            Most brands Loyalty Programs out there are built on the same basic idea: the more you buy, the more you save. We are <i>*so*</i> used to it we carry a bunch of cards in our wallets and handbags.
          </p>
          <p class="citation">
            But these don't make us feel more <i>*loyal*</i> to these brands.
          </p>
          </p>
            We don't go to a specific store because we know we nearly have the required amount of patiently gathered points over the last six months to get that 1% discount. We go there because we want to buy something and oh! it appears we have a loyalty card for that store! Purchase acts are definitely not driven by the Loyalty Programs in place.
          </p>
          <p class="citation">
            Same applies to web-stores.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of this because of the same recurring fallacy: <strong>most Loyalty Programs, despite their name, don't reward the most <i>*loyal*</i> customers, but the most <i>*buying*</i> customers</strong>. And this nearly always mechanically excludes the most engaged ones (who are more often than not distinct customers).
          </p>
          <p class="citation">
            We thought there must be a better way.
          </p>
          <p>
            A better way to engage people on the long haul, a better way to reward customers based on their <i>*effective*</i> loyalty to a brand. No more one-size-fits-all strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
            And this is where gamification comes into place. By combining proven yet powerful game mechanics, we could design compelling Loyalty Programs to raise customer engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            As engineers and game players, we thought it was worth giving it a try. So we decided to follow Steve Blank's strategy: test the problem, test the solution, iterate on what you learn from your adventurous <i>*earlyvangelists*</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are watching our very first attempt; we are still testing the problem. I hope you will enjoy the journey.
